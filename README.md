### **Course Project Proposal: Career Recommendation System Using Machine Learning**

#### 1. **Project Title:**

**"Career Recommendation System Using Machine Learning: Personalized Career Suggestions Based on Interests and Aptitudes"**

#### 2. **Objective:**

To develop a machine learning-based web application that provides career suggestions to users based on their interests, skills, and academic performance. The system uses a trained model to match user profiles with suitable career paths, aiming to guide students and professionals in making informed career decisions.

#### 3. **Motivation:**

Choosing a career path is one of the most crucial decisions in a person's life. However, many students and early professionals are unaware of career options that match their strengths and preferences. This project is motivated by the need to help users find suitable careers using data-driven insights, reduce the stress of career selection, and make personalized guidance more accessible.

#### 4. **Scope:**

* Collecting input on user interests, skills, and preferences.
* Developing a predictive model using machine learning (classification techniques).
* Designing a web interface to collect inputs and show recommendations.
* Providing top 3–5 career suggestions with relevant descriptions.
* Deploying the application online using Replit or a cloud platform.

#### 5. **Methodology:**

##### 5.1 Data Collection:

* Use publicly available datasets or create a small dataset with attributes such as interests, skill ratings, subject strengths, and career labels.
* Clean, preprocess, and encode the data using techniques like normalization and one-hot encoding.

##### 5.2 Model Development:

* Train a classification model using algorithms like Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Logistic Regression.
* Evaluate models using cross-validation and select the best-performing one based on accuracy and F1-score.

##### 5.3 Web Application:

* Use **Flask** to build a lightweight backend.
* Develop simple HTML forms to collect user input and display results.
* Use a `model.pkl` file to load the trained model and make predictions in real-time.

##### 5.4 Testing:

* Check model predictions for various input combinations.
* Validate form behavior, error handling, and output display.

#### 6. **Tools and Technologies:**

* **Languages:** Python, HTML, CSS
* **Frameworks:** Flask for backend, Sklearn for ML, Pandas for data handling
* **Libraries:** Numpy, Joblib, Matplotlib
* **Deployment:** Replit or Flask on PythonAnywhere
* **Collaboration:** Google Drive, GitHub, or Replit team invite
* **Project Management:** Trello, WhatsApp for updates

#### 7. **Challenges and Solutions:**

* **Data Size Limitations:** Start with a smaller dataset; simulate with synthetic data if needed.
* **Model Accuracy:** Apply feature engineering and try multiple algorithms.
* **Team Coordination:** Use shared tools like Replit, Drive, and Trello to manage collaboration.
* **Limited Technical Background:** Assign tasks with learning resources and tutorials for each role.

#### 8. **Expected Outcome:**

* A working web app that predicts careers based on user input.
* A trained and saved ML model with decent prediction accuracy.
* Simple and clean UI to collect and display results.
* Project report detailing approach, results, challenges, and learnings.
